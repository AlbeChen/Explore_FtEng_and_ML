## Kaggle's Titanic Challenge
**The independent learning process of analyzing, cleaning, and modeling a dataset** <br/>

**Language:** Python &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Libraries:** pandas, sklearn, seaborn, numpy

This is my first attempt at creating a model from any programming language after completing multiple crash courses on Python, pandas, machine learning, and more. Therefore, starting on this project was my way of pulling all my learning together into a single report which could show my progress in my independent learnings. My goal coming into this project was to create a thorough analysis on the Titanic challenge in Kaggle and tackle the general data science process when approaching an objective.

In this report, I've accomplished **(1)** the visualization and analysis of each feature in order to extract applicable data, **(2)**  the clean implementation of pipelines for each custom function to clearly preprocess the data, and **(3)** completing a holistic report from dataset to completed model for the first time.

After completing this project, I’ve learned so much, but also more importantly realized how much there is to data science that I don’t know. I look forward to improving and learning even more in the future.
