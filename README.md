## Exploring Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Methods
**A learning exercise on the methods in processing and modeling a dataset to extract knowledge and insights** <br/>

**Language:** Python &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Libraries:** pandas, sklearn, seaborn, numpy

This was my first attempt at creating a model from any programming language after completing multiple crash courses on Python, pandas, machine learning, and more. Therefore, starting on this project was my way of pulling together all my learnings into a single report which could show my independent progress. My goal in the report was to tackle the general data science process when approaching an objective by familiarizing myself with different methods of approaching each step. From learning the methods and reasonings to fill missing data, to comparing models’ advantages, this project allowed me to explore challenges that can arise.

In this report, I've accomplished **(1)** the visualization and analysis of each feature in order to extract applicable data, **(2)**  the clean implementation of pipelines for each custom function to clearly preprocess the data, and **(3)** the completion of a holistic report from dataset to completed model.

After completing this project, I’ve learned so much, but also more importantly realized how much there is to data science that I don’t know. I look forward to improving and learning even more in the future.
